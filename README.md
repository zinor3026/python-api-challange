# Python-api-challange
Module 6
## Description:
There are two parts in this challenge. The first one is WeatherPy where we will create a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 ciites of varying distances from the equator. The second one is VacationPy wehre we use the weather data and look for hotels to according to our preference. 
 ## Installations
 I used pandas, hvplot, numpy and linregress from scipy.stats.
 ## Other Instructions:
The jupyter notebooks are named as VacationPy and WeatherPy. The csv created and exported from WeatherPy can be found in the output_data. 

 ## Contributing
All the problems are solved with the help of the activities and the solved folder in Homework section. 
Going throught the recordings of classes and activities helped me finish this challenge. 
Here are some codes that I refered from the homework solved file:
1. Defining the funtion for liner regression plot; I struggled creating the function therefore it is refered and edited.
2. "units=Metric&" on the url was not added at first but the max temps were above 100 therefore, I refered and got to know that I was missing "units=Metric&" from my initial url.
